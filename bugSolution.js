The solution focuses on robust error handling within the asynchronous operation.  The improved code includes comprehensive try...catch blocks to handle potential errors gracefully:
```javascript
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

const fetchData = async () => {
  try {
    const value = await AsyncStorage.getItem('@my_key');
    if (value !== null) {
      console.log('Value retrieved successfully:', value);
    } else {
      console.log('No value found');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
    // Additional handling for error, such as displaying an alert to the user
    // or retrying the operation after a delay.
  }
};

//Further improvements could involve using a dedicated error reporting service
//or more sophisticated retry strategies for transient network errors.
```
By implementing thorough error handling and potentially replacing problematic third-party libraries, the risk of unhandled promise rejections can be minimized.  Testing with various scenarios is also recommended to ensure the stability of the improved code.
