# Unhandled Promise Rejection in React Native with Third-Party Library

This repository demonstrates a bug related to unhandled promise rejections when using a third-party library within a React Native application. The issue occurs due to improper promise handling within the third-party library, causing crashes or unexpected behavior during asynchronous operations.

## Bug Description

The bug is characterized by an unhandled promise rejection originating from a third-party library's asynchronous functions.  This often manifests as crashes or silent failures without clear error messages. The root cause usually lies in how the library handles promise resolution and rejection within the React Native environment.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully examining the third-party library's code or contacting the library maintainer for support. Often, wrapping asynchronous calls with appropriate error handling mechanisms (e.g., try-catch blocks) can mitigate the issue.

In some cases, replacing the library or using a more robust alternative may be necessary.
