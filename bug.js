This error occurs when using a third-party library that's not properly integrated with React Native's environment, specifically concerning asynchronous operations and how they handle promises.  The library might be trying to use Node.js-specific features that aren't available in the React Native runtime.  The code might look something like this:
```javascript
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

const fetchData = async () => {
  try {
    const value = await AsyncStorage.getItem('@my_key');
    if (value !== null) {
      // Use the value
      console.log('Value retrieved successfully:', value);
    } else {
      console.log('No value found');
    }
  } catch (e) {
    // error reading value
    console.error('Error fetching data:', e);
  }
};
```
If the third-party library doesn't handle promise rejection properly within the React Native environment, this could lead to crashes or unexpected behavior.  The problem might be deeply nested within the third-party dependency.
